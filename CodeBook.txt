DESCRIPTION OF ORIGINAL FILES:
Files can be grouped in 3 categories:
- GENERAL FILES: Containing labels and related information.
- TRAIN FILES: Cointaining data for the TRAIN group.
- TEST FILES: Cointaining data for the TEST group.


CLEANING PROCESS:
1.  TRAIN and GENERAL files were combined with the intension to add labels to the TRAIN dataset. Result = 1 table (traindata1).
2.  TEST and GENERAL files were combined with the intension to add labels to the TEST dataset. Result = 1 table (testdata1).
3.  TRAIN and TEST tables were merged to have one single table with all observations. Result = 1 table (SOURCETABLE).
4.  Non-essencial variables were removed from the table (Mean and STD variables were kept)
5.  All variables were averaged by ACTIVITY. Result = 1 table (AVGTABLE)
